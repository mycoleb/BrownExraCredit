Why did you pick this programming language?
Because I used to teach python to kids.



How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Classes and Objects: Defined using the class keyword.
Inheritance: Supported, allowing classes to inherit from other classes.
Encapsulation: Achieved through private and protected attributes.
Polymorphism: Supported through method overriding and interfaces.
File Ingestion:
Reading CSV Files: Using pandas.read_csv().
Reading Text Files: Using built-in open() function.
Conditional Statements:
if, elif, else: Standard conditional structures.
Assignment Statements:
Single Assignment: Using =.
Multiple Assignments: Using a, b = 1, 2.
Loops:
for: Iterates over a sequence.
while: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
Subprograms (Functions/Methods):
Functions: Defined using the def keyword.
Methods: Functions defined within a class.
Unit Testing:
unittest module: Standard library for writing and running tests.
Exception Handling:
try, except, finally, else: Structures for handling exceptions.



List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
pandas:
What it is: Data manipulation and analysis.
Use: Reading CSV files, processing data frames, and performing data analysis.
numpy:
What it is: Numerical operations.
Usage: Handling arrays and performing efficient mathematical operations.
matplotlib:
What it is: Data visualization.
Usage: Creating graphs and charts to visualize data.

To find the company with the highest average phone body weight, 

I extracted the body_weight for each phone where available
Grouped the weights by oem and calculated the average for each
Motorola has the highest average body weight at 201.5g  for 2 phones with weight data.

Motorola Razr 2019 - announced 2019, released 2020
Motorola One Hyper - announced 2019, released 2020
21 phones have only one feature sensor.
2005 had the most phone launches in the 2000s decade with 50 phones released that year
